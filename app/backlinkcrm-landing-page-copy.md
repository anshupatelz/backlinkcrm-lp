## Problem Statement Section

### Headline:
**Right now, you have no idea which of your $10,000 worth of backlinks just went 404.**
**Or turned no-follow. Or changed anchor text.**

### Supporting Text:
Every hour you waste in spreadsheets is an hour not spent on growth.  
Every missed link issue is DR points bleeding away.  
Every manual check is a scaling bottleneck that's keeping you small.

**The truth: You can't scale a link-building operation on spreadsheets and prayers.**

Your team is drowning in tabs. Your clients want real-time updates. Your backlinks are dying silently. And you're the one staying late to check everything manually.

Auto-generated. White-labeled. Always up-to-date. Stop wasting Fridays on reporting.

### Headline:
**Here's what manual checking is actually costing you:**

### Cost Breakdown:
**Time Cost:**
- 4 hours daily checking links manually
- 2 hours updating spreadsheets
- 3 hours creating client reports
= **45 hours/week wasted** (That's a full-time employee)

**Money Cost:**
- $3,000-8,000 in undetected dead paid links
- $2,000/month if you hired a VA to check
- $500-1,500 per lost client who left due to poor reporting
= **$60,000+/year** bleeding from your business

**Opportunity Cost:**
- Can't take more clients (you're maxed out)
- Can't pursue bigger partnerships (no bandwidth)
- Can't scale your team (too much manual work)

## FAQ Section Additions

### Key Questions to Address:

**"How fast will I see ROI?"**
Most users find enough dead links in the first day to pay for 6 months of service. The time savings kick in immediately — that's 20 hours back in your week starting now.

**"What if I have 50,000+ backlinks?"**
Perfect. The more links you have, the more time you're wasting manually. We monitor millions daily. Your 50K links are nothing to our system.

**"Do I need technical knowledge?"**
Zero. If you can read an email alert that says "This link died," you can use BacklinkCRM. It's that simple.

**"What about my team?"**
Add everyone. Unlimited users. Assign links to team members. Track who's responsible for what. Finally, accountability.
